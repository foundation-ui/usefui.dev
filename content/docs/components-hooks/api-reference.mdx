<DocsTextBlock className="m-b-medium-60">
  Components are built using the [Compound
  pattern](https://www.patterns.dev/react/compound-pattern/), they manage their
  own internal state and share them among the other components within the same
  `Root`.
</DocsTextBlock>

<DocsTextBlock className="m-b-medium-60">
  `Root` components always refers to the internal [Context
  API](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) used to share internal
  states.
</DocsTextBlock>

<DocsTextBlock className="m-b-medium-60">

###### When the Compound pattern is used, you can import the Component Hook to access its internal functions and adjust the component behavior to handle complex interactions and or mutations.
